            <H2>Self Sorting Pool Table</H2>
            
            <p>For a class project, my friends and I build a self sorting pool table. 
                Bttrpie is a compact, portable self-sorting pool table that takes over
                 the tedious job of sorting and resetting balls between games on a 
                 custom-built mini table. It brings together three main elements: a 
                 collection system that guides balls from the pockets into a 
                 single-file chute, a 3-axis gantry and claw that can identify, sort, 
                 and move the balls, and a pool table structure that stays fully 
                 playable while discreetly supporting the robotics. Within this setup, 
                 Bttrpie uses onboard sensors and layered software to recognize ball 
                 colors, arrange them in the correct order, and load them into a 
                 triangle before sliding the rack into the proper break position for 
                 the next game. The goal is to showcase a practical, well-integrated 
                 hardware–software system that can reset a game of pool with minimal 
                 human involvement, while still working within real constraints like 
                 a limited number of motors, fixed cable lengths, sensor limitations, 
                 and the need to keep the system lightweight and easy to transport. </p>
